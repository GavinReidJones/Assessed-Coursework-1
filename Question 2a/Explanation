In a file gauss quadrature.cpp write a C++ function called gauss quadrature which
calculates the quadrature points and weights (xi
, wi), i = 1, . . . , n, where xi, i = 1, . . . , n,
are the zeros of the nth order Legendre polynomial Pn(x). The function gauss quadrature
should be declared to be void; the arrays to store the quadrature points and weights should
be dynamically allocated before calling gauss quadrature. To compute xi, i = 1, . . . , n,
use a Newton iteration for each root; as an initial guess for the ith root xi, i = 1, . . . , n,
let x(0)i = − cos ((2i − 1)/2n )π)

Write a test program called q2a.cpp to compute the quadrature points and weights when
n = 2, 4, 7.
