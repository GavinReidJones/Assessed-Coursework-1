Based on the code you have written in part(a), in a file diff legendre.cpp write a C++
function called diff legendre which evaluates the derivative of the nth order Legendre
polynomial Pn(x) at a given point x. Write a test program called q1b.cpp to compute
the following values: P02(0.3), P06(âˆ’0.5) and P09(0.4).
